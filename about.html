            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <P>The year was 1980 when WakeCup was imagined after experiencing some of the finest
                coffees on an educational trip to Brazil and the South Americas. We wanted to break the
                monotony of low profile, non-descript coffee that was doing rounds in those cafeterias of the
                80s. But life threw us in a different direction, and we ended up in the tech industry with a
                desire to get into the world of coffee someday.
                In 2005, that dream was brought to fruition when we quit our jobs and started WakeCup.
                Ever since then, we’ve gone around the world in search for the best beans and we couldn’t
                be happier. We love spreading smiles through our coffee. Our quest has taken us around the
                world to some of the finest plantations and estates, many of whom work with us directly or
                indirectly.
                In 2016 we started conducting workshops and became the primary sponsors of the Bean King
                Champion contest. Our baristas have won global accolades and we love serving cuppa
                goodness.</P>

            <p>WAKECUP, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, 
            is India’s favourite hangout for coffee and conversations. 
            we strive to provide the best experience to our guests. 
            Our coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters,
            who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives.
            We opened our first cafe in 1996 at Brigade Road in Bangalore 
            the youth and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, 
            and it continues to be one of the most happening places in the city. </p>
